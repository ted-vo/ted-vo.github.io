I am Vo Thanh Nhon and I am a Software Engineer and I am a Cat lover.

When I was a kid, I followed my cousin to the Internet shop.
I just stood behind him and looked at him playing Counter-Strive.
My mind was blowing. I have loved video games and had a passion for computers since.
I had wished to become a game developer.

When I was in high school, I started to research MU game servers
via forums (ragezone, clbgames,...). That is the kind of game I really really like.
I had successfully set up the first server on my PC at home, and my friends can play at the
Internet shop near my house. That was so awesome. But that was last time I did something about video games.
Anyway, that was my first milestone in becoming a Software Engineer for now.
